Fitness Wear,Sports Bra,SG Ready Stock | NEW REEZY Resistance Bands (Washable Anti-Slip) - Set of 3pc Fabric Resistance Bands (Glute Hip Bands),"1. Should I get the 12.5 inches or 14.5 inches?
• The length of bands should be determined by the circumference of your thighs (area above your knees) where the bands will be worn most often. Do measure the widest part of your thigh (single thigh width). If your thigh width is between 36cm and 50cm, 12.5 inches may be better for you. If your thigh width is between 51cm and 65cm, 14.5 inches may be preferable. Should you prefer a different size from what you’ve ordered, we’d be happy to do a free exchange for you at our office at Peninsula Plaza.

2. How tight should the bands be?
• It’s generally a personal preference of how tight you’d like the bands to be. A guide would be if you’re an Asian build of about 160cm and 45kg, 12.5 inches would suit you. If you’re 165cm and 60kg, then perhaps the 14.5 inches would suit better. But again, it is a personal preference. 

3. Can I wash the bands?
• Yes, you can! Just hand wash the bands with cool running water and light washing detergent to prevent colour runs and premature wear-and-tear.
